"""BusDelay -- a multi-mode delay: CLEAN, GRAIN (pitched), REVERSE.

Two 32K lines on the shipping core (741 ms of TIME): LineL the shared half,
LineR core 1's private FX2 buffer region Y:0x4000-0xBFFF, which the reverb's
tank owns on core 0 and nothing writes on core 1 (port, 15 Sep 2026). The
DEV hatch keeps two 16K lines (tools/remix/geom.py).

Clones SPRING REV's descriptor. A cloned descriptor inherits the donor's
display formatter, which overrides the value count, so every slot below
states its renderer. TIME's formatter is the tempo-sync cave, registered
over slot 0 by that module.
