"""<Module name> -- one line on what it is.

Copy this directory to modules/<yourname>/ and edit. Directories starting
with `_` are skipped by the registry, so this file is never built.

Say what the module is, what it changes, what is measured and what is
open. Delete every comment below once answered.

docs/remixer/MODULES.md is the guide; tools/remix/schema.py the field list.
This is the skeleton of a DSP effect. modules/character/ is a finished one
(an in-place insert with its own render gate). A module that changes what
the firmware does starts from modules/_template_cf/ (then modules/repitch/,
modules/midi-scenes/).
