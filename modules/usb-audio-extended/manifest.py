"""USB AUDIO EXTENDED -- the unit as a UAC2 audio input, 20 channels at 44.1 kHz 24-bit.

High speed: the eight tracks' L/R (post-FX, pre-fader) on channels 1-16,
MAIN on 17-18, CUE on 19-20. Full speed: the tracks' stereo sum.
markandrus (octemu, MIT); MAIN/CUE Bryan T. A DRAM unit with build-time
detours. Needs USB MIDI: the audio function joins its composite, and the
ISR shim chains to USB MIDI's. README.md has the design and what was
measured. USB AUDIO FULL (modules/usb-audio-full, the sixteen track
channels) and USB AUDIO MASTER (modules/usb-audio-master, track 8's two)
assemble the same source with another USB_LAYOUT.
