| usbaudio.s -- USB AUDIO: twenty channels over USB (UAC2).
|
| Channels 1-16: the eight tracks' L/R, post-FX pre-fader, from the
| read-back arena the eDMA fills every block. Channels 17-20: MAIN L/R and
| CUE L/R, the DAC feed. 44.1 kHz, 24 bits in 4-byte subslots, a 250 us
| poll at high speed; the tracks' stereo sum at full speed.
|
| Based on markandrus/octemu custom/coldfire/usb-audio.s at 6a9ff68 (MIT).
| The shims, the EP3 bring-up and the UAC2 class-request replies are his.
| Here it is a DRAM unit: the loader places it and zeroes its data, every
| hook is a detour in manifest.py, and the ISR shim chains to USB MIDI's by
| symbol (the units link together; schema.Override). README.md has what
| was measured.

| ---- the track source: the read-back arena ----
| The eDMA deposits every track's post-FX, pre-fader block into SRAM each
| frame; the RECEIVE machine sums the same memory. Layout: RB_BASE +
| bank*1024 + track*128 + frame*8, two 32-bit words (L,R) per frame, 16
| frames per block, 8 tracks, ping-pong banks. The producer reads the
| PREVIOUS bank (the pipeline is one block deep). Track level, the
| crossfader, MAIN volume and the master effects are downstream of this tap.

| 2/3 and 0/1 (P:0x2df, P:0x2e2) into the host read-back after the track
| blocks; the frame ISR's chain ch1 -> ch6 -> ch7 lands them here, ch6
| writing 0x80005e60..0x80005f60 each frame: 16 x (L,R) at +0x00, then
| 16 x (L,R) at +0x80, 32-bit words in the read-back's format (24 bits,
| left-justified). The stock recorder reads the same buffer for SRC3 =
| MAIN (+0x00) / CUE (+0x80) from inside frame_isr (0x4000d2a0), before
| this hook; the next frame's ch6 cannot overwrite it until the next
| frame_isr. Single buffer, no ping-pong. MAIN = +0x00, CUE = +0x80

| ---- frame geometry --------------------------------------------------------
| The producer fills TWO rings per frame: an 80-byte slot (20 channels, each a
| 4-byte little-endian subslot carrying 24 bits: track 1 L/R first, track 8
| L/R on 15/16, then MAIN L/R on 17/18 and CUE L/R on 19/20) for the HIGH
| SPEED stream, and an 8-byte stereo sum of the eight
| tracks for FULL SPEED. Both are indexed by the same frame count, so the
| wrap arithmetic has one form.
|
| A sample is the read-back word with its low byte cleared: the arena's
| full scale is 2^31, so the subslot's 24 valid bits are its top 24.
|
| Why the poll is 250 us: 20 ch x 4 B at 44.1 kHz is 3,528 B per
| millisecond, and one high-speed isochronous transaction carries at most
| 1,024 B. At bInterval 2 a packet is 11.025 frames x 80 B = 882 B, at most
| 12 frames = 960 B with the servo. Full speed carries the stereo sum only:
| 44.1 frames x 8 B = 353 B per 1 ms frame, under the 1,023 B cap. UAC1
| cannot poll faster than 1 ms even at high speed (Apple TN3190: bInterval
| must be 4); this is why the descriptors are UAC2.
.if USB_LAYOUT == LAYOUT_T8
| Two channels: T8's (L,R) is the one slot, 8 bytes, the same ring at both
| speeds (the full-speed "sum" ring is this ring). 44.1 frames x 8 B is 353 B
| a millisecond, one transaction, so high speed polls every 1 ms too
| (bInterval 4): one packet a millisecond at either speed, at most 360 B.

| ---- SET_INTERFACE shim (installed at 0x4001dd04) ---------------------------
| Displaced: movel 0xfc0b01c4,%d0. Interface 4 (AudioStreaming) records the
| requested alt setting and completes the status stage; any other interface
| falls through to the stock handler unchanged.
|
| The shim RECORDS the request. Everything that builds EP3 state — the
| queue head, the dTDs, ENDPTCTRL3, the ring cursors — is done by the frame
| ISR (audio_ep3_up / audio_ep3_down), the one context that also queues
| packets. This runs from the USB interrupt; if it re-initialized the
| endpoint itself, a SET_INTERFACE landing in the middle of a kick would
| rewrite a queue the kick was still building, and the kick would then prime
| the remains. One owner, one byte of shared state.
|
| The one exception is alt 0's FLUSH, done here as well: the host may send
| its next IN within microseconds of the status stage, before the frame ISR
| has had its block, and a packet already queued would answer it — audio
| after teardown. A flush only cancels what is in flight, is idempotent, and
| builds nothing, so it is safe from this context; the kick checks the
| request byte before it queues, so nothing new follows it; and the frame
| ISR flushes again on its way down. (verify_usb asserts silence after
| alt 0.)
|
| Interrupt levels, from the firmware's own INTC writes: the USB interrupt
| is INTC1 source 47 at level 4 (moveq #4 / moveb ->0xfc04c06f at
| 0x4001e024); the frame IRQ is EPORT IRQ1 at level 5 (0x4001fc30). So the
| frame ISR can preempt this shim — harmless, it only ever sees the request
| byte — and this shim can never interrupt a kick.

| ---- EP0 buffer-page fix (installed at 0x4001d4b2 inside usb_ep0_send) -------
| usb_ep0_send sets only the dTD's buffer PAGE 0 (0x4ec95028), never PAGE 1.
| A descriptor whose buffer crosses a 4 KB page then transmits only the bytes
| before the boundary and zeros after (seen in his build as the full-speed
| config truncated to the stock 32-byte MSC part). This shim also fills
| PAGE 1 = (buffer & ~0xfff) + 0x1000, so an EP0 send that spans a page
| boundary completes wherever the descriptors are linked.
|
| Displaced: movel %a0@,0x4ec95028 (a0 = &buffer-arg, set by the preceding
| lea %sp@(12),%a0); rejoin at the following lea (0x4001d4b8). %d0 is dead

| ---- the iso packet builder -------------------------------------------------
| Each packet holds the next n frames from the ring: n = 11/12 at high speed
| (11025/1000 per packet) or 44/45 at full speed (44100/1000), so the emitted
| stream is an exact, gap-free substring of what the producer wrote. Underrun
| queues nothing (the host's IN gets an empty packet); a producer that laps
| the ring (host stopped draining) resyncs and counts an overrun.
| Runs from the frame shim only; may clobber every register but %sp.
|
| An isochronous IN cannot NAK: an IN token that arrives with nothing primed
| is answered with a zero-length packet, and a hole in the stream is a
| click. The frame ISR keeps up to NSLOT packets queued and the controller
| chains from one to the next on its own.
|
| The slots are used in turn: aud_tail is the next to fill, so fill order is
| tail-3, tail-2, tail-1 (oldest to newest) and the controller retires them
| in that order. A slot whose dTD is still ACTIVE is in flight or queued and
| is left alone.

| Displaced: movel 0xfc0b01c0,%d0 — the first instruction of the stock
| "unknown request: STALL EP0" tail, which every request the dispatcher does
| not recognise falls into. A UAC2 host asks the CLOCK SOURCE for its sample
| rate before it will publish a device (RANGE + CUR of CS_SAM_FREQ_CONTROL,
| CUR of CS_CLOCK_VALID_CONTROL, all class GET to the AudioControl interface
| with the entity id in wIndex's high byte), and a STALL there means no
| audio device. Everything else falls through to the stock STALL, which is
| the legal answer for a control we do not implement.
|
| Reply the way the stock string-descriptor path does: push the buffer and
| min(wLength, len) and jump to the shared usb_ep0_send tail. d2 still holds
| wLength here (nothing between the dispatcher and the stall touches it). The
| reply buffers are constants in this unit's data: the EP0 send DMAs them
| straight out of memory.
