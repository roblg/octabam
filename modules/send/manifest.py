"""SEND -- the bus client every other track runs: DEL into the delay, REV into
the reverb.

It taps the audio buffer and never writes it, so a SEND at SEND 0 is
indistinguishable from no effect; a fresh, unassigned track (FX2 id 0) is
aliased to it rather than to NONE because, unlike NONE, it performs the
per-block bus housekeeping, so no track can stall the bus.

Clones FILTER's descriptor. Slots 2-11 are blanked but keep FILTER's
defaults and value counts (not drawn; writing them would change bytes for
no reason). No formatter is declared, so the knobs keep FILTER's
plain-numeric zeros (hardware-confirmed). REV took blank slot 1 on 25 Sep
2026: a part saved earlier holds FILTER's slot-1 byte there, so stamp it
(`ot_project.py stamp-slot <project> SEND REV`).
