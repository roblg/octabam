"""CHARACTER -- the station that dirties or tightens.

A per-track insert on stock LO-FI's id 0x1c (FX1 only; an FX2 instance runs
as a dry pass, decided from the allocator base at init). Chain order:
fold -> saturate -> tilt -> compress -> width.

  * FOLD -- a wrap-and-reflect wavefolder at a held level;
  * SAT -- three JClones (MIT) characters: TAPE = TapeHead (a state-variable
    split at TONE, the low and band parts through a cubic smoothstep, the
    top clean), TUBE = DaTube (u - u^P, the negative half driven twice as
    hard, level-compensated), INFL = OInflator (a signed cubic; DRV is its
    Effect). DRV 0 skips the stage, bit-exact;
  * TONE -- a tilt after the saturator, drawn -64..+63; 0 flat, bit-exact;
  * COMP -- JClones AC1's console channel law: GLUE (slow) on the master
    by position, COMP (fast) elsewhere; the detector's key is the station's
    own input;
  * WDTH -- mid/side width, drawn -64..+63: -64 mono, +63 2x side.
