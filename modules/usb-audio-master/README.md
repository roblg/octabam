# USB AUDIO MASTER

The unit as a USB audio input (UAC2, 44.1 kHz, 24-bit), two channels:
track 8's L/R, post-FX, pre-fader, on channels 1/2 at both USB speeds.
With MASTER TRACK on, track 8 is the mix through T8's effects, before T8's
LEVEL and MAIN volume. Needs USB MIDI.

[USB AUDIO EXTENDED](../usb-audio-extended/README.md)'s source,
`usbaudio.s` (markandrus/octemu, MIT), assembled with `USB_LAYOUT = 2`.
The variant is Sam Banks's (27 Sep 2026):

- **Producer.** Reads T8's two read-back words per frame (the same words
  as EXTENDED's channels 15/16, the same 24-bit format) and writes one
  8-byte slot per frame into a 1,024-frame ring. No other track, no
  MAIN/CUE, no stereo sum.
- **Both speeds send the same ring, one packet a millisecond.** 44.1
  frames × 8 bytes is 353 bytes, one transaction, so high speed polls every
  1 ms (bInterval 4) as full speed does: 44/45 frames, at most 360 bytes.
  EXTENDED and FULL poll every 250 µs at high speed.
- **Descriptors.** USB MIDI's descriptor unit declares a two-channel input
  with bmChannelConfig front left + front right (`0x3`, the standard stereo
  cluster) in the input terminal and AS_GENERAL, at both speeds; 24-bit
  samples in 4-byte subslots, a fixed 44.1 kHz clock, as EXTENDED.
- It takes the same hook sites as EXTENDED and FULL, so a remix carries
  one of the three.

## Measured under the port

`verify_usb` with `REMIX=usb-master` and `REMIX=bottleservice`
(27 Sep 2026):

- EP `0x83` isochronous, 360 bytes, bInterval 4; AS_GENERAL 2 channels,
  bmChannelConfig `0x3`.
- 352/360-byte packets at high speed, none empty after the first ten;
  every subslot's low byte zero; counters: 0 overruns, 0 underruns.
- Taps: with the read-back arena re-poked before every poll with words that
  name their source, side and frame, channel 1 carries T8 L and channel 2
  T8 R, only those, at high speed and at full speed.

## Per block and per millisecond

Counted from the source, instructions executed (not cycles):

| | EXTENDED | MASTER |
|---|---|---|
| producer, per block (16 frames) | ~2,710 | ~180 |
| read-back words read per block | 320 | 32 |
| packets built per ms (high speed) | 4 | 1 |
| bytes copied into packets per ms | ~3,530 | ~353 |
| packet builder + copy per ms | ~750 | ~250 |

`modules/cfmeter` (CF METER) measures the frame interrupt's duration and
main's idle time on a unit; the port's `--profile` samples every 64
instructions and gives no exact count.

## Not measured

- Anything on hardware.
- Which channels an iOS app records by default. The descriptor declares a
  plain two-channel front L/R input; an app that takes the first two
  channels gets T8.
- Full speed on a phone: whether an iPhone or its adapter connects at high
  or full speed. Both carry T8.
