"""THE TWO SENDS (DEL into the delay, REV into the reverb), measured on both
cores (the hardwired rig).

Every case below renders through tools/harness/dsp_host with BOTH payloads booted
(docs/remixer/HARNESS.md "Two cores"): the senders and the delay on payload B where
the unit runs them, the reverb on payload A, so the chain buffer and its
liveness stamp cross the real core boundary. The image is the rig remix
(registry.fixture: the smallest carrying both servers, SEND, the stations and RIG HOSTS) as SPEC -- the stations must be in it. Since 20 Sep 2026 each
engine's wet comes out on the track that hosts it (the hosts are not fed, so
a host's stream IS its engine's wet*WET); there is no return station.

  both sends   T2/T6 at DEL 100 REV 100: T5 (reverb host) prints the
               reverb, stereo; T1 (delay host) prints the delay; identical
               under four skews
  REV only     T1 prints nothing; T5 == the same layout without the delay,
               bit for bit
  DEL only     at DLY 0 T5 prints nothing; at DLY 127 it prints the reverb
               of the repeats; T1 does not depend on DLY
  phantom      a DEL-only send leaves T5 bit-identical (DLY 0), a REV-only
               send leaves T1 bit-identical: an idle knob registers nothing
  host SEND    the reverb host's own SEND reaches the reverb only
  WET 0        a host at WET 0 prints nothing but its (silent) dry
  the reverb takes nothing out
               T1's print is bit-identical with the reverb at WET 0, at WET
               127 and with no reverb at all
  T8 refused   a SEND at core-0 position 3 (track 8) with SEND 127 changes
               nothing (the master's input is the mix, the hosts' wet
               included: a send from it would loop the bus)
  T4 sends     the mirror position on core 1 does
  old bytes    a Character with slot 4 stored 127 (RET in a pre-20-Sep
               part), on T8 or T4, prints nothing of its own and changes
               neither host; a station with the old send bytes (slots 4/5 =
               127) contributes nothing to the bus

What this cannot show: the chip's timing (lock-step, or a guessed -skew),
and anything the ColdFire does (knobs are poked into r6).
