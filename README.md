# octabam

[![CI](https://github.com/sambanks/octabam/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sambanks/octabam/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

An unofficial community remixer for the Elektron Octatrack's operating
system, not affiliated with Elektron: pick the modifications you want and
build them into one firmware image from your own copy of OS 1.40C.

A modification is a **module** (`modules/<name>/`), a selection of modules
is a **remix** (`remixes/<name>/remix.py`), and `make image REMIX=<name>` composes
a remix into a card-flashable image: placing code, wiring hooks by symbol,
refusing collisions by name, and proving every ported module against its
author's own build byte for byte. No firmware is distributed here; every
image is derived from the user's own 1.40C on the user's machine.

Every module is contributed by its author and credited in the table
below. Pull requests are accepted: a module, a port of an existing mod, a
fix, a doc correction (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/remixer/MODULES.md`).
Issues are disabled and there is no request queue. The licence is MIT; a
fork that takes requests and tracks issues is allowed.

**[docs/remixes/BUILDING.md](docs/remixes/BUILDING.md)** is the step-by-step
guide from a fresh machine to a flashed unit; its §8 is how to write a
remix of your own.
**[docs/remixes/README.md](docs/remixes/README.md)** lists every remix with
its contents and how far it has been proven; each remix's own README is
beside its selection in `remixes/<name>/`.

## What it carries

Every module, with its author. Those with a repository are built from it.
The table is rendered from the manifests (`make docs`; `make check` refuses
a stale copy). `make modules` prints the same index with the compatibility
matrix (which ColdFire modules can share an image, from the same check the
build makes; `✓*` is a pair that needs the named bridge) and every remix.
The last column is how far the module has been proven: `make check`
(builds and boots under the port), a local render, port-gated (a gate
under the ColdFire port pins its behaviour), or on hardware, with the
unit, image and date.

<!-- modules:end -->

## Quick start

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sambanks/octabam
cd octabam
make setup                          # toolchain (macOS + Homebrew; docs/WSL.md for Linux)
make os && make recon               # your own 1.40C -> out/raw/section_3_MAIN_OS.bin
make image REMIX=ok-ms BUILD=1      # -> out/OCTATRACK_OCTABAM1.bin
```

`make check REMIX=<name>` runs every gate and boots the image under the
local ColdFire emulator. `make remix` opens the TUI remixer
(`docs/remixer/REMIXER.md`).

## How it works

```
modules/<name>/manifest.py   what a module is and what it claims (yours, or a pointer into an author's repo)
remixes/<name>/remix.py      which modules, in which chooser order; README.md beside it
tools/remix/ledger.py        refuses two modules that claim one address, hook, id or buffer, by name
tools/build/build_bus.py     the build: assembles, links, places, wires, verifies -> out/mainos_bus.bin
tools/verify/*               the gates: oracles, the boot under the ColdFire port, menu, cycles, identity
```

A module's code lands in one of three places; the build decides which bytes
go where, and a module declares what it is, not an address:

| class | declared as | where |
|---|---|---|
| ROM cave | `CavePatch`: a `.s` source, or ratified hex | one of the OS image's free zero runs, ~8 KB total shared by everyone |
| DRAM unit | `Linked(..., dram=True)`: a GNU-as unit | linked with every other DRAM unit in the remix into one runtime, packed, appended behind octabam's loader, depacked at boot into a 10 MB reserve carved off stock's 85.5 MB sample/recorder pool |
| appended runtime | `Runtime`: a recipe (Octakit's `firmware.json`) | its own reserve of the same pool, as a second payload of the same loader |

The OS-image edits every class needs — a detour at a stock instruction, a
poke, a grown table — are `Detour`, `Poke`, `TableGrow`, wired by symbol and
asserted against stock before a byte is written. `docs/remixer/PLACEMENT.md`
is the map of what is free and what was measured.

**A port is a proof.** The build re-links every unit at the author's own
address and compares, rebuilds Octakit's runtime to the identities her
recipe pins, and refuses on any drift. `CONTRIBUTING.md` is the contract;
`docs/remixer/MODULES.md` the guide to writing a module.

**Where a module's state lives.** An effect's twelve knobs are Part
parameters and stay in the Part. Personal material (Octakit's Kits,
octalab's grooves) is in files the module owns and formats. A module's
settings (how it behaves or looks: menu options, a USB profile) have no
shared home yet: Octakit and octalab each write their own files, and the
other modules keep none. The shared settings store for all modules, OTX
(`otx.work` / `otx.strd` in the project folder, one record per module,
unknown records preserved byte for byte by any firmware that saves), is
specified in
[`docs/proposals/OTX_PROJECT_PROPOSAL.md`](docs/proposals/OTX_PROJECT_PROPOSAL.md)
(nordseele, draft 2, 26 Sep 2026) with author-facing
[guidelines](docs/proposals/OTX_MODULE_GUIDELINES.md);
not implemented. `docs/remixer/MODULES.md` "Settings on the card" says
what a module declares under it.

## Checking without a flash

The DSP side renders locally on the assembled instruction stream (`make
render`, `make render-rig`; `docs/remixer/HARNESS.md`). The whole machine
— ColdFire, both DSP cores, the card, the panel, MIDI, USB — runs under a
port of it (`tools/emu/ot_emu`, `make emu-cf`):

```bash
make check REMIX=<name>             # boots the image under the port; OT_PROJECT=<dir> adds a real project
make reach                          # the gates this branch's diff reaches, in order; RUN=1 runs them
make panel REMIX=<name>             # the virtual front panel with sound at localhost:8563 (tools/panel/README.md)
make emu-live REMIX=<name>          # the screen and keys in a window, no sound
```

`docs/remixer/EMU.md` covers all of them and the Unicorn routes the
label gates use. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `make ci`) runs the checks that
need no firmware; `CONTRIBUTING.md` says what those cover and what they
cannot. What the emulators cannot see — caches, the recorder,
cross-core timing — is listed beside every gate that is blind to it.

## Before you flash anything

**Writing a non-official OS to an Octatrack can leave it unusable and puts
your warranty in question.** Nothing here is endorsed by, supported by, or
affiliated with Elektron. `docs/remixer/FLASHING.md` has the recovery path;
`docs/remixer/FAILURE_MODES.md` is the register of what has gone wrong on a
unit and why. Back up projects before flashing anything that changes them
(Octakit migrates Parts to Kits on load; downgrading may lose Kit data).

MKI and MKII run the same 1.40C image (hash-verified). sambanks's effects
have only been tested on an MKII; the DRAM platform has run on an MKI
([octalab](https://github.com/nordseele/octalab-notes), 11 Sep 2026;
`octatrick-usb` on Tim Hastie's, 26 Sep 2026) and on midisc's author's
unit (`ok-ms`, 14 Sep 2026).

**No Elektron binary is redistributed here, and none may be.** A built
`.bin` or `.syx` contains Elektron's OS: do not share built images. Share
the repo; everyone builds their own.

*Octatrack* and *Elektron* are trademarks of Elektron Music Machines MAV

**Em** ([emuyia](https://github.com/emuyia)) designed Octakit and the
loader-appended DRAM runtime octabam adopted as its large-payload placement;
`tools/remix/loader.S` is derived from hers with attribution. Her repository
invites use as a submodule to combine with other efforts.

This began as a fork of [mxldyn/octamax](https://github.com/mxldyn/octamax)
by Maxolydian, whose reverse engineering of the OS format, memory map and
parameter tables made any of this reachable; the upstream history is in
this repository's log.
