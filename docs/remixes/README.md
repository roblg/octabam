# Remixes

A remix is a named selection of modules; `make image REMIX=<name>` builds it into a card-flashable image from your own OS 1.40C. [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) is the step-by-step guide. Each remix is a directory, `remixes/<name>/`: `remix.py` is the selection and `README.md` says what is in it and where it has run. This index is rendered from the selections (`make docs`). BUILDING.md §8 says how to write one.

## The rig
