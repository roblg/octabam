# Contributions received: the dated index

Reverse-engineering results and notes contributed by others, by date, with
where each now lives. The facts themselves are in the
topical docs with their status markers (✅ re-verified here · 🟡 adopted on
the author's evidence · ❌ retracts something written here) and the
author's name beside them. Until 22 Sep 2026 this file held the findings
in full, fourteen sections; that text is the topical docs now, and the
ingest record with the notes exchanged verbatim is
`git show 3ceba41:docs/history/EXTERNAL_INGEST.md`. All were derived from
the officially distributed OS 1.40C (`section_3_MAIN_OS.bin` SHA-256
`164f3122…`, base `0x40000400`).

| 23 Sep 2026 | nordseele | [`octalab-notes`](https://github.com/nordseele/octalab-notes) `40ffa53` → `e0dc56d` (nine commits, 13–22 Sep): a FAT directory record's first cluster is the long at `+0x11e`; the storage-job entry `0x40024168` takes its kind/object from `0x460be9e8`/`ec` and a stock save path ran on a MKI; a recorder-reserve figure from the emulator; a held trig under a page of one's own; the SETUP windows' draw calls and the eight font records; their own `+0x10` trig-mask label and current-pattern/part mapping lowered to 🟡 | `STORAGE.md` §1 ✅; `SAMPLE_SAVE.md` §7 ✅; `RECORDER.md` §2 🟡; `MAINMENU.md` §6b; `PANEL.md` §2–3; `PARAM_PAGES.md` §5g |
| 22 Sep 2026 | markandrus (public repo, not sent to us) | [`octemu`](https://github.com/markandrus/octemu) at `8ccdd84`'s dsp56300 pin (QEMU 11.1 + dsp56300 + SDL2 Octatrack emulator, credits this project as inspiration): three MAC-with-load decode defects in Unicorn's vendored QEMU, confirmed against Unicorn's own source; that `vendor/dsp56300` was 144 commits behind upstream, absorbing several of our own fixes independently; the DMA "de-renewal" semantics for a same-value DCR rewrite mid-window. His three ColdFire firmware customisations (RECEIVE machine, USB-MIDI, USB-Audio) and `re/*.syms` (768 ColdFire + 150 DSP symbols) were reviewed 22 Sep and not adopted then; on 25 Sep 2026 USB-MIDI and USB-Audio were ported onto the DRAM platform (`modules/usb-midi`, `modules/usb-audio-extended`) with the port's own USB device-controller model (`tools/emu/ot_emu/usb.h`, his bench protocol) as the off-device gate; his QEMU and dsp56300 patches beyond the three above did not apply to our Unicorn/dsp56300 or were JIT-only, N/A to `execInterpreter()` | `tools/patches/unicorn_emac_fractional.patch` ✅ (PR #360); `AGENTS.md` History (the re-pin, PR #365; the DE-renewal, PR #367); `docs/remixer/EMU.md` (the "no MAC-with-parallel-load form" retraction) |
| 23 Sep 2026 | Jannik Aßfalg (repeat98) | `STOCK_PROFILE.md`: a stock-firmware ColdFire instruction profile under his port build (frame ISR, delay, sample analysis, voice renderer extents); the port's ACCext write knew only the fractional layout, which the frame ISR's integer-mode save/restore reaches every frame; `FUN_4000c8a4` is not a function boundary. His `stock-analysis-fast` module and `--work-profile` counter were not sent | `tools/emu/ot_emu/v4e.cpp` + `test_emac.cpp` ✅ (eight assertions); `docs/remixer/EMU.md` (the fix; the profile 🟡, the extents ✅); `MIDI.md` ❌ the label; `COLDFIRE_DELAY.md` the routine's end ✅ |
| 25 Sep 2026 | Tim Hastie | [`octa-panel`](https://github.com/timhastie/octa-panel) at `be68244` (a fork of this repository, 10-25 Sep 2026, MIT): the virtual front panel over the firmware's own panel-UART stream (LCD blocks 0x10-0x17, LED rows, the key matrix, encoders, crossfader); the port's real-time mode with sound (the DSP cores as JIT worker threads, O17-O17c) and two vendored-JIT defects (MPYI's immediate unsigned -- upstream fixed it independently; a bit op on an M register left its modulo words stale); the DMA timers on the 132 MHz bus (DTRR2 = 132,000,000 for one second); the Echo Freeze Delay's memory-to-memory eDMA copies and the TCD's ATTR/SOFF order; the EMAC -1 x -1 product; the firmware mounting the last set at boot once the sys tick runs. His modules (direct-jump, quantizer, synth) were not ported | `tools/panel/` ✅ (PR); `tools/emu/ot_emu` ✅ (the lockstep block dump equals main's with his three model changes reverted); `docs/firmware/COLDFIRE_PORT.md` O14i-O24 🟡 (his records) |

Modules that arrived as code rather than notes (midisc, Octakit,
octalab, REPITCH) are the README's module table and `THIRD_PARTY.md`.
